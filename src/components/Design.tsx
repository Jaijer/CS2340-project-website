        In implementing this application, we aimed to use concise, easy to 
        manage and clear code to foster reusability and align with best code practices. 
        As such, we made use of design patterns such as the <strong>Observer</strong>, <strong>Factory</strong>
        , and <strong>Singleton</strong> patterns to organize various classes.
