        Throughout this project, we started from only a concept to develop a functional application over the course of several months. We had to learn and utilize software that was new to most of us - Android Studio and Firebase to create a meal logging app with tracking functionalities. This required us to collaborate, research and ask for help where needed to ensure the success of the team. 

        <br /> <br />We implemented various elements to enhance the application including a pantry, personal cookbook and global cookbook features. We also ensured that user information was linked in the database so that each logged in user would have access to their own saved database of meals. This project combined front-end development with designing and creating user-friendly screens, with the back-end of developing and maintaining a database. For most of us, this was therefore our first foray into full-stack development. 

        <br /> <br />As this was our first time creating such an application, we experienced several challenges along the way. In the initial stages of the project, we had some timeline setbacks due to unforeseen events. We had some difficulty with syncing the database and had to restructure a decent portion of our code to rectify the problems. Having to balance this project alongside other school work and exams required us to strategically assign elements of the project to align with individual schedules to ensure the best result. We began implementing a system that involved assigning specific line items to every team member to make expectations clear.
